        "* Controlling access using key cards, biometric scans, or security codes.\n",
        "* Ensuring the room has climate control (HVAC) to prevent overheating.\n",

        "What is a \"Phishing Attack\"?\n",
        "A phishing attack is a type of cybercrime where attackers attempt to trick individuals into divulging sensitive information (like usernames, passwords, and credit card details) by disguising themselves as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication, often an email. The goal is typically to steal data or install malware.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is the difference between POP3 and IMAP, and what is SMTP used for?\n",
        "POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3) is a protocol used for receiving emails. It typically downloads email messages from the server to the local device and then deletes them from the server. This means that accessing your email from multiple devices can be challenging since each device will only have locally stored copies of the messages.\n",
        "IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol), on the other hand, allows users to access their emails directly on the mail server without downloading them to their local device. This makes it easier to manage and synchronize emails across multiple devices, as all changes made on one device are reflected on the server and visible on others.\n",
        "SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is responsible for sending outgoing emails from a client to a recipient’s mail server. It works alongside either POP3 or IMAP to ensure that emails are delivered correctly between servers before being accessed by the end-user.\n",
        "To summarize, POP3 and IMAP are protocols for receiving emails, with IMAP offering better synchronization across devices, while SMTP handles the sending of emails.\n",
        "\n",
        "How do you handle difficult users who may be frustrated with their technology issues?\n",
